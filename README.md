<h1>Site4SoreEyes</h1>

<h2>User-Centric Frontend Development - Milestone Project One - Code Institute.</h2>

<h2>Project Summary</h2>
The idea behind the project is to help introduce a user friendly site with some basic information.
This Website is aimed to provide all the information you need to look after your sight, the simplest way possible.

<h3>Website</h3>
A deployed link to the website can be found here. <br />

<h3>UX</h3>
My UX process is to make looking after your eyes easy. My project is aimed at users who want information on common eye conditions, advice on picking the right frames, and finding an opticians nearby. 

<h2>User Stories</h2>
<h3>Site Users</h3>
As a glasses wearer, I want to get information on conditions, frames and find nearby opticians, so that I can look after the health of my eyes. 

<h3>Site Owners</h3>
As the site owner, I wanted to achieve a singular place glasses or potential glasses wearers will come for all their optical information. 

<h2>Strategy</h2> 
<h3>Technical Capabilites</h3>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<h3>Skeleton</h3>
<p>The homepage will be a landing page for the user and give them a clean, easy to follow design offering concise information. Most of the sites information is on this page in a </p>
<p>The second page incorporates information using Google maps to locate all the nearby Opticians for simple, fast action on taking care of your eyes.</p>
<p>The third and final page, uses a contact form (Not currently functioning) so users can submit any concerns or questions they may have.</p>
<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li> - The building blocks (programing langauge) of the project
  <li>CSS</li> - Use for styling the website
  <li>Bootstrap - Used for the responsive design and collapsable navbar</li>
  <li>Gitpod - An IDE used to write the code</li>
  <li>Git - Used for version control</li>
  <li>jQuery</li> - The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
  <li>Font Awesome - Use for all the icons on the website</li>
</ul>

<h3>Design Decisions</h3>
<p>The site was designed with a clinical aspect. It needed to be clean, free from clutter, bite size information and easy to use.</p> 
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Nav bar that is easily used, acccesable and fluid.</li>
  <li>Contact section to speak with us.</li>
  <li>Smooth scrolling which is better UX.</li>
  <li>Eye catching images.</li>
  <li>Google Maps linked to local Opticians</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features left to implement</h3>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>During the initial stages of the project I used Chrome developer tools for testing my site. Using the device toolbar to continually check that my structure and content worked on the mobile and desktop screen as intended. I frequently tested the different classes and rules that were applying to different elements to bug test on things that weren't behaving as they should, but also to test out possible solutions before moving those solutions into my code.</p>

<p>I have tested the site in a range of browsers Chrome, Opera, Firefox, Microsoft edge and Internet explorer.</p>

<p>I ran the HTML and the CSS through W3C Validation services to ensure that the code that I have written does not have any syntax errors.</p>

<h2>Results and Outcomes</h2>

<h2>Deployment</h2>
This site is hosted using Github pages, and is deployed directly from the master branch. You can view the website https://noelquirke.github.io/Site4SoreEyes/index.html
